She didn’t mean to drop the glass. But it shattered like it wanted to.
Her hand just stopped gripping, that was all.
A soft unclenching. Not rage. Not grief. Just… letting go.

“I didn’t ask for this,” Laurie said.
But David was already outside, pretending to check the car, pretending the silence between them had grown so loud it needed a whole driveway to contain it.

He always left when she said anything that sounded like a truth.

Rain started. Not hard, not cinematic, just the slow, persistent kind that seeps into sleeves and heads and marriages.

Laurie picked up a shard and looked at it, wondering if it was sharp enough to matter. Then she laughed — not the funny kind, the bitter exhale kind — and dropped it back on the floor.

“You’re bleeding,” came a voice from the hallway. Her son. Twelve. Awake again.
“Go back to bed,” she said, not turning around.

He didn’t.
He stood there in his Marvel pajamas and bare feet, watching her like someone watches a stranger they once called mom.

“You okay?”
“Yeah. Just tired.”
“You dropped the glass again.”
“Yeah.”

He padded over and hugged her waist. Small arms. Familiar weight.
And for the first time in weeks, she let herself cry.

Outside, David opened the car door, sat in it, and didn’t start the engine.
